Using Add-one smoothing
i. Training phase: Compute the emission probabilities of a bigram HMM tagger directly on the
training set using Add-one smoothing.
ii. Using the new probabilities, run the algorithm from c)ii) on the test set. Compute the error
rate and compare it to the results from b)ii) and c)iii).
