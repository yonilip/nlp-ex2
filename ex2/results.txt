Most-Likely:
	Error rate for unknown words - 0.79
	Error rate for known words 0.08
	Total error rate 0.16

Bigram HMM
	Total error rate 0.93
	This is so high since a sentence with at least one unknown word will be tagged randomly, and most senetences in the test data indeed have unknown words.

2. Add-One Smoothing
	Total error rate 0.29

3. Pseudo-Words
	Total error rate 0.12
    (This is with Add-One smoothing for the transitions. Smoothing isn't needed for words
    as low-frequency words are replaced with Pseudo-Words anyway)

    Observing the confusion matrix, the most frequent errors are NN instead NNS (1.6% of all words) and 
    JJ instead NN (0.6% of all words). Next error types are lower than 0.04%.
    This is quite reasonable to expect those kinds of errors, since NNS (Plural Noun) and NN have a similar grammatical role.
    JJ instead NN is less obvious
