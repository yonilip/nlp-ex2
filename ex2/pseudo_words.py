(e)
Using pseudo-words
i. Design a set of pseudo-words for unknown words in the test set and low-frequency words in
the training set.
ii. Using the pseudo-words as well as maximum likelihood estimation (as in c)i)), run the Viterbi
algorithm on the test set. Compute the error rate and compare it to the results from b)ii),
c)iii) and d)ii).
iii. Using the pseudo-words as well as add-1 smoothing (as in d)i)), run the Viterbi algorithm
on the test set. Compute the error rate and compare it to the results from b)ii), c)iii), d)ii)
and e)ii). For the results obtained using both pseudo-words and add-1 smoothing, build a
confusion matrix and investigate the most frequent errors.
